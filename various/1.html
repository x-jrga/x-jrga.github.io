<h3 class="boldtxt ctrtxt">Getting Things Done Software</h3>
<h3>This is the initial concept. I may implement this if there is
time.</h3>
<h3>This is my interpretation of Getting Things Done (GTD), a
productivity approach, represented as a finite state machine
diagram using LTSA. Here is the <a href="files/gtd.lts"><b>model
for diagram</b></a>. Use the LTSA Animator to produce a sequence of
actions.</h3>

<h3>The <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/"><b>LTSA (Labelled
Transition System Analyser)</b></a> is really useful and cool
software. It helps me think.</h3>
<h3>Is there one of these for git development process?</h3>
