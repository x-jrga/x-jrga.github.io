Mixed Veggies Salad #1

Ingredients:

1) 500 g of H-E-B Select Ingredients Mixed Vegetables
2) 250 g of cooked pinto beans
3) 13 grams of canola oil
4) 1 sucralose (Splenda) packet
5) 3 grams of salt
6) 7 grams of ground flax seeds
7) 20 almonds
8) 30 grams of raisins

To Prepare:

What I do is mix 500g of frozen mixed vegetables (5lb bag, HEB or Walmart), 250g
 of cooked pinto beans and 1 tablespoon of canola oil and stir-fry it for 15 min
utes. It will be a little bit toasted when the time is up. It gives it a little 
extra flavor. After it is ready, I add splenda, a pinch of salt, ground flax see
ds, almonds and raisins. It tastes really good, is nutritious, is good for your 
digestive system and health in general and is inexpensive. It will give you all 
the fiber you need for a day.

Comment: 

It is a recipe (food combination) that will do wonders and keep you regular. This 
is one of my inexpensive, healthy, useful favorite salads. 

Some people may disagree with me about the use of an artificial sweetener but it
s use lowers glycemic load of my diet and it allows me to eat more food. In other 
words, I can spend more of my calorie budget on food other than sugar which 
only gives you calories but no health promoting compounds.
