  abstract  = {The metabolism of carbohydrates is largely determined by their chemical properties. Glucose may have been selected, over the other aldohexoses, because of its low propensity for glycation of proteins. That carbohydrate is stored in polymeric form (glycogen) is dictated by osmotic pressure considerations. That stored fat is about eight times more calorically dense than glycogen, when attendant water is factored in, accounts for the predominance of fat as a storage form of calories and, also, for the fact that ingested carbohydrate is oxidized promptly (that is, fuel of the fed state) rather than being extensively stored. That stored glycogen is accompanied by so much water accounts for the fact that the brain only has very small glycogen stores. Carbohydrate has two important advantages, over fat, as a metabolic fuel; it is the only fuel that can produce ATP in the absence of oxygen, and more ATP is produced per O 2 consumed when glucose is oxidized, compared with when fat is oxidized. These advantages probably determine the preference of many cell types for carbohydrate. In addition to its use as a metabolic fuel, glucose plays other important roles such as provision of NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway, and as a source material for the synthesis of other key carbohydrates, for example, ribose and deoxyribose for nucleic acid synthesis and substrates for the synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans. It can also play a key role in anaplerosis. Although it is widely acknowledged that gluconeogenesis plays a crucial role in starvation it is now apparent that prandial gluconeogenesis occurs, both in the metabolic disposal of dietary amino acids and in the synthesis of glycogen by the indirect pathway. Although there is, strictly speaking, no dietary requirement for carbohydrate it is evident that glucose is a universal fuel for probably all cells in the body and carbohydrate is the cheapest source of calories and the major source of dietary fibre. These observations, together with the fact that glucose is the preferred metabolic fuel for the brain, permit us to recommend appreciable quantities of carbohydrate in all prudent diets.},

  abstract = {Energy expenditure and macronutrient balances were assessed in normal healthy men by whole-body indirect calorimetry after meals consumed with and without ethanol to test the theory that alcohol energy is not fully available because of futile cycling. Alcohol addition (A) or isoenergetic substitution (S) caused fat retention by significantly suppressing its oxidation when the alcohol was actively metabolized (0-6h). However, on protocol S, fat balance was later reestablished due to raised fat oxidation (6-20.5 h) secondary to a relative carbohydrate deficiency. On protocol A, fat balance remained significantly raised. The thermogenic effect of alcohol was similar to that of carbohydrate, providing no evidence for futile cycling. Short-term studies that fail to account for later readjustments of macronutrient balance can be misleading. We conclude that alcohol has a fat-sparing effect similar to that of carbohydrate and will only cause fat gain when consumed in excess of normal energy needs.},

To preserve homeostasis, most of the glucose and fat absorbed must be stored to be mobilized later at rates appropriate to bring about the oxidation of a fuel mix matching on average the macronutrient distribution in the diet. The body's glycogen stores are so small that regulatory mechanisms capable of efficiently adjusting carbohydrate oxidation to carbohydrate intake have developed through evolution. Fat oxidation is regulated primarily by events pertaining to the body's carbohydrate economy, rather than by fat intake. Adjustment of fat oxidation to intake occurs because cumulative errors in the fat balance lead over time to changes in adipose tissue mass, which can substantially alter free fatty acid concentration, insulin sensitivity, and fat oxidation. Fat intake and habitual glycogen concentrations are important in determining how fat one has to be to oxidize as much fat as one eats.},

One of the most readily quantifiable measures by which to juddge the effect of various inherited and circumstantial factors on energy metabolism and body composition is the percentage body fat for which weight maintenance occurs. The amount of body fat for which the steady state of weight maintenance tends to become established is therefore a key fact on which an undderstanding of boddy weight regulations should be based, rather than rates of energy turnover or past circumstances that may have led to fat accumulation, as often beleived.},

  abstract = {A theoretical analysis of the energy metabolism associated with the conversion of glucose to fat is presented. In tissues where the pentose cycle furnishes some of the NADPH required for fatty acid synthesis, this conversion is an ATP-yielding process. In rat adipose tissue the maximal rate of glucose conversion to fat can be quantatively predicted on the basis of the tissue's ability to use the ATP which is generated in excess during this conversion. The energy-generating nature of this process provides the means for a type of regulation which depends on metabolic state and which, during fasting, contributes to the sparing of carbohydrate. Impairment of lipogenesis in the fasting state is attributed to a decrease in the activity of the malate cycle and to the presence of free fatty acids. However, rather than by inhibiting specific enzymes, it is by virtue of their quality as substrates for energy production that free fatty acids and their CoA derivatives appear to inhibit de novo lipogenesis. The regulatory phenomena discussed here may explain the failure of the attempts made to identify the rate-limiting step for de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue.},

By contrast, fat oxidation was correlated negatively with daily variations in food intake on each diet, being inhibited by carbohydrate intake ( <ce:italic>R</ce:italic> =  .65). Such results reflect the priority given in metabolic regulation to the maintenance of carbohydrate balance over the maintenance of fat balance, as well as over energy balance, which was linked very tightly to the latter ( <ce:italic>R</ce:italic> = .91 and .95). Fat oxidation appeared to be determined by the gap between overall energy expenditure and the sum of carbohydrate plusprotein energy ingested ( <ce:italic>R</ce:italic> = .9), rather than by the amounts of fat consumed.
