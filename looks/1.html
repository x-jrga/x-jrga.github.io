            <h3>The purpose of this software is to facilitate color comparisons 
                and selection. User can create different color combinations and 
                export them as a text file. Users can then import them and 
                recreate the color palettes. Users can easily share these text
                files.</h3>
            <h3>I created this sofware so I could look at different color 
                combinations and use those in my designs.</h3>
